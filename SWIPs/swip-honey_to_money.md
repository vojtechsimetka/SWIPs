## Simple summary 
Swarm needs a mechanism to allow fluctuation of the exchange rate between honey (Swarms internal accounting unit) and the currency used to pay. We propose an on-chain price oracle that returns an exchange rate + validUntil tuple.  

## Abstract 
The ability to update prices is required in order to:
* Facilitate experimentation with the absolute price of honey (e.g. start at a low price and gradually increase);
* Off-set fluctuations of the currency used to pay;
* Lower the price of Swarm in the long-run as the costs of operating a Swarm node decreases.

We propose an on-chain price oracle that returns the current exchange rate when queried. The price-oracle will be initially managed by Swarm developers and stakeholders.

This SWIP is part of a series of SWIPs (but can be implemented on it's own). To see the full picture, please refer to [swip-message_to_honey](./swip-message_to_honey.md), [swip-multiple](./swip-honey_to_money.md), [swip-multiple_payment_processing_support](./swip-multiple_payment_processing_support.md) and the diagram below:

## Motivation
Nodes keep track of the balances with each other nodes using an imaginary currency: honey. Since honey is not a currency in which nodes can settle their balances with each other - it is merely a unit of account - there is a requirement to facilitate converting honey to a currency. Furthermore, it is desirable that this conversion rate can fluctuate since:

* The Swarm developers plan to initially set the price of honey very low and progressively increase this price to the point where it is sufficiently high to incentivize nodes to offer their service to the network while being low enough not to scare away potential users of Swarm. 
* We expect the price of the counterpart currency to fluctuate in value against the costs of operating a Swarm node. As the real benefits (i.e. the worth of your compensation) of operating a Swarm node shouldn't fluctuate, the honey price should fluctuate inversely against the fluctuations of currency. If this happens, the real benefit stays equal, regardless of price fluctuations of the currency in which compensation is paid. 
* The costs of operating a Swarm node is expected to decrease over time, as hardware becomes cheaper, the code more optimized etc. The price of honey is therefore expected to decrease to stay competitive to other storage solutions. 

This update process should be atomic: either all nodes upgrade or none. If we would update the prices in the Swarm source code (as is currently the case), it will affect that, while not all nodes are on the same release, nodes with By externalising the price to an oracle, we can completely decouple the basic functioning of Swarm - which is heavily focused on data availability, delivery, and security considerations - from the price discovery. By building support for price oracles, we can coordinate price changes across the network, and set the stage for future experimentation with various mechanisms for setting prices, from DAOs, to bonding curves, to fixed prices. This SWIP makes no recommendation for the eventual pricing mechanism, it only prepares the network for adopting them in future.

In the current implementation, honey prices are hardcoded. When this price in codebase changes, it does not affect previous release; an old release expects a settlement of honey to be worth a different amount in currency. Eventually, this will result in nodes who run different versions of the software to disconnect from each other as the difference in prices will cause balances to be updated differently on each node. This SWIP proposes an on-chain price oracle to enable an atomic update process of honey prices without requiring nodes to update their source-code.

## Specification
* The Swarm source code will reference the address of a `HoneyToMoney` price oracle
* The price oracle implements the `HoneyToMoney` interface (to-be specified) 
* The `HoneyToMoney` contract will be initially owned by an M/N multi-sig of Swarm developers and stakeholders.
* Before sending a payment (denominated in currency), a node will query the `HoneyToMoney` price oracle to get the most up-to-date price conversion. 
* Upon receiving a payment, nodes will determine the honey amount paid by looking up and dividing by the currently valid price from the oracle. This might cause payment imbalances between nodes, as the oracle might be queried one or several blocks before the transaction was sent. To avoid this situation, we propose that nodes include a payload with the transaction, specifying the time at which the oracle was queried.

## Rationale
We need a way for prices in the Swarm to change over time. However, due to the nature of Swarm - specifically independent connections between pairs of nodes each with their individual accounting and payments - there is no clear price discovery mechanism. Furthermore, since Swarm nodes are expected to be conduits for both payments and data (buy from one peer and sell to the other) it is necessary for nodes to coordinate price changes with all their peers. In short, we need a mechanism for network-wide changes in pricing that the peer-to-peer routing and accounting does not provide.
By externalising the price to an oracle, we can completely decouple the basic functioning of Swarm - which is heavily focused on data availability, delivery, and security considerations - from the price discovery. By building support for price oracles, we can coordinate price changes across the network, and set the stage for future experimentation with various mechanisms for setting prices, from DAOs, to bonding curves, to fixed prices. This SWIP makes no recommendation for the eventual pricing mechanism, it only prepares the network for adopting them in future.

## Backwards Compatibility 
This SWIP is backward compatible as long as the price oracle quotes the same prices as is currently hard-coded in non-upgraded Swarm nodes. It is up to the owner of the MsgToHoney oracle to ensure that he does not update prices too much while not all nodes that run are on the new Swarm version. Currently, the Swarm is not running with a live test net for settling prices, so we expect no problems with this SWIP if it is implemented before the Swarm will go live with price-incentivization.
